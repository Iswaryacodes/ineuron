Question no: 1. Carefully observe this example.
 function OuterFunction()
 { 
     var outerVariable = 100;
     function InnerFunction() 
     {
         alert(outerVariable);
     }
     return InnerFunction;
 }
 var innerFunc = OuterFunction();
 innerFunc();


a) Is the InnerFunction() a closure?
Ans: Yes, InnerFunction() is a closure. 

b) What is output of this program
Ans: 100

Question no: 2. What is the difference between a closure and a scope ?
Ans: Closure is inner function of a nested function whereas scope is variables that are used in.
say, from the given example, the variable outerVariable is used in innerfunction/closure. 
so the scope of this variable is within this entire nested function. 
this is also called as lexical scope.



Question no: 3. What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?
Ans: Lexical scope is, to access a variable(s) in a zone. 
In a nested function, the inner function is closure. 
Here, inner function cas access those variables from the outer function to reduce code redundancy.
